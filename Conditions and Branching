1) Comparison operators:
Equal: ==
Not equal: !=
Greater than: >
Less than: <
Greater than or equal to: >=
Less than or equal to: <=

2) Conditions equal:
i=5
i==6
False

3) Greater than sign:
i=6
i<5
True

4) Not equal to:
i=6
i!=6
False

5) If statement example:
age=19
#age=18

#expression that can be true or false
if age > 18:
  #within an indent, we have the expression that will run if the condition is true
  print("you can enter")
#the statements after the if statement will run regardless is the condition is true or false
print("move on")

6) Else statement example:
age=18
#age=19
if age > 18:
  print("you can enter")
else:
  print("go see Green Day")
print("move on")

7) Elif statement example:
age=18
if age > 18
  print("you can enter")
elif age==18:
  print("go see The Strokes")
else:
  print("go see Green Day")
print("move on")

8) Condition statement example:
album_year: 1983
album_year: 1970
if album_year > 1980:
  print("Album year is greater than 1980")
else:
  print("less than 1980")
print('do something..')

9) Logical operators: 
and
or 
not

10) Condition statement example:
album_year=1980
if(album_year>1979) and (album_year<1990):
  print("Album year was in between 1980 and 1989")
print("")
print("Do Stuff..")

11) album_year=1980
if(album_year>1979) and (album_year<1990):
  print("Album was not made in the 1980's")
else:
  print("The album was made in the 1980's")
  
12) album_year=1983
if not(album_year=='1984'):
  print("Album year is not 1984")
